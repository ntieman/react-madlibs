<p>Every Friday, my parents go out to [[verb]] the night away and Becky comes over to baby-sit. She's so [[adjective]]! She's in high school, which means she's really [[adjective]] and can drive a [[noun]]. She even has a pierced [[body part]], which my Mom says is [[adjective]], but I think it's cool.</p>

<p>Becky doesn't make us follow any [[adjective]] rules. She always gets us a [[noun]] for dinner and lets us eat with our [[plural noun]]. One time, she tought me how to make milk [[verb]] out of my [[body part]]. She always lets us stay up late watching [[adjective]] movies and she doesn't even make us brush our [[random]] before bed!</p>

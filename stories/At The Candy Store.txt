<p>My favorite store is the [[Adjective]] Spot candy store. They have more [[plural noun]] than you can fit in your [[body part]]. There are chocolate-covered [[plural noun]], tasty jelly beans, and [[adjective]] never-ending lollipops. You can [[verb]] them for hours and they never shrink!</p>

<p>One time, I dared my [[adjective]] little brother to stick five super spicy [[plural noun]] in his [[noun]] for a full minute. After ten seconds, he started [[verb -ing]] and then his face turned all [[adjective]]. My mom got so [[adjective]] when she found out. I wasn't allowed to [[verb]] any kind of [[noun]] for a whole month. Boy, did I learn a [[adjective]] lesson! Next time, I'll dare him to put them in his [[noun]] instead.</p>

<p>For my birthday, my parents bought me a pet [[noun]]. He is so cute that I named him [[Noun]]. He has a really long [[random]] and I love to pet his [[adjective]] skin. I bought him a [[adjective]] collar that he wears around his [[body part]]. And I'm teaching him to [[verb]] and to come when I [[verb]]. Every time he does a trick, I say, &ldquo;Good [[noun]]!&rdquo; and feed him a [[noun]].</p>

<p>Next, I'm going to teach him to catch a Frisbee in his [[random]]. Every night, he sleeps on a [[noun]] right next to my [[adjective]] bed. And in the morning, he rubs his [[body part]] on me to wake me up. What a [[adjective]] pet!</p>

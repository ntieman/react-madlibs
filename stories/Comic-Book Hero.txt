<p>My favorite comic book character is the Purple [[noun]]. She's a superhuman creature with tons of [[adjective]] powers. When a bad guy attacks, her [[noun]] turns  into the size of a [[noun]] and shoots out a poison [[noun]]. She is able to make any enemy [[verb]] with fright. Her sidekick is a giant purple [[noun]] who starts to [[verb]] whenever he smells trouble. And she rides around in a [[adjective]] jet that's shaped like a [[noun]]. When she isn't fighting crime, she poses a [[adjective]] purple mark right above her [[noun]]. When I grow up, I hope I [[verb]] just like her!</p>

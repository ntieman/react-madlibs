<p>My dad took me to the [[verb]] mall to buy me a [[adjective]] new pair of sneakers. My old ones were too [[adjective]] and they a had a [[adjective]] hole in the toe. Any time I stepped in a puddle, my [[verb]] would get totally [[adjective]]. At the mall, we went to the [[random]] Shack, where they sell the best [[noun]] in town. I picked out a [[adjective]] pair and tried them on. I was so excited, I started [[verb -ing]] right there in the store. Dad said they made my feet look like [[random]]. They were [[adjective]]! I love my new sneakers and they are great for [[verb -ing]] in puddles.</p>

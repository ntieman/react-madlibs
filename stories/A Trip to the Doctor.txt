<p>The other day, I woke up and my [[random]] was sore. I looked in the mirror and started to [[verb]]. My skin was all [[adjective]] and there were little [[adjective]] spots all over it! My dad told me not to [[verb]] and took me to the doctor.</p>

<p>When we got there, the nurse stuck a [[noun]] into my [[body part]] to take my temperature. Then she told me to [[verb]] for one minute while she got the doctor. The doctor was a [[adjective]] woman with bad breath and a cold [[random]] that she pressed into my [[noun]]. She said I had the worst case of [[random]] pox she had ever seen!</p>

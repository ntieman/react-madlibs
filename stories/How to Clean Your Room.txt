<p>2) If you find an old [[noun]] lying on the floor, pick it up and [[verb]] it to see if it's clean. If it smells [[adjective]], stick it in a drawer.</p>

<p>3) Make a giant [[noun]] out of all the [[adjective]] clothes lying on the floor. Then cover it up with a large [[noun]]. Or use your [[random]] to help you [[verb]] everything under the bed.</p>

<p>4) Offer to give your little brother a [[noun]] if he cleans your room. He's probably too [[adjective]] to know you don't mean it!</p>
